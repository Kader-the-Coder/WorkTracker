# WorkTracker

A simple, clean time tracking app for freelancers and focus-driven individuals. Built with Flask and vanilla JavaScript.

## Why I’m Building This

As a freelancer, I needed a less cluttered alternative to Toggl — something lightweight, easy to use, and built for *me*.

## Features (Planned)

- [x] Start/stop time tracking sessions
- [ ] Create and manage projects
- [ ] View daily and weekly summaries
- [ ] Export session logs as CSV
- [ ] Mobile-friendly interface
- [ ] Clean UI using Bootstrap

## Tech Stack
