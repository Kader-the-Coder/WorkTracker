# WorkTracker

A simple, clean time tracking app for freelancers and focus-driven individuals. Built with Flask and vanilla JavaScript.

## Why I’m Building This

As a freelancer, I needed a less cluttered alternative to Toggl — something lightweight, easy to use, and built for me.

## Features (Planned)

- [x] Start/stop time tracking sessions  
- [ ] Create and manage projects  
- [ ] View daily and weekly summaries  
- [ ] Export session logs as CSV  
- [ ] Mobile-friendly interface  
- [ ] Clean UI using Bootstrap  

See the [design document](docs/DESIGN.md) for more details.
